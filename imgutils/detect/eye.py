    Detect human eyes in anime images.

    This function uses a YOLOv8 model to detect eyes in the given anime image. It supports
    different model levels and versions, allowing for a trade-off between speed and accuracy.

    :param image: The input image for eye detection. Can be various image types supported by ImageTyping.
    :type image: ImageTyping

    :param level: The model level to use. Can be either 's' (for higher accuracy) or 'n' (for faster processing).
                  Default is 's'.
    :type level: str

    :param version: Version of the model to use. Default is 'v1.0'.
    :type version: str

    :param model_name: Optional custom model name. If not provided, it's constructed using version and level.
    :type model_name: Optional[str]

    :param conf_threshold: Confidence threshold for detections. Only detections with confidence above this
                           threshold are returned. Default is 0.3.
    :type conf_threshold: float

    :param iou_threshold: Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold for non-maximum suppression.
                          Detections with IoU above this threshold are considered overlapping and merged.
                          Default is 0.3.
    :type iou_threshold: float

    :return: A list of detected eyes. Each detection is represented by a tuple containing:
             - Bounding box coordinates as (x0, y0, x1, y1)
             - Detection class (always 'eye' for this function)
             - Confidence score of the detection
    :rtype: List[Tuple[Tuple[int, int, int, int], str, float]]

    :raises: May raise exceptions related to image loading or model prediction (from yolo_predict function).
