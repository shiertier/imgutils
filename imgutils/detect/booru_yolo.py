Overview:
    This module provides functionality for object detection using the Booru YOLO model.

    The Booru YOLO model is sourced from `aperveyev/booru_yolo <https://github.com/aperveyev/booru_yolo>`_ and
    model files are hosted on `deepghs/booru_yolo <https://huggingface.co/deepghs/booru_yolo>`_.

         - Description
       * - yolov8n_as01
         - 2023.12
         - Spinoff model with 26 classes trained for 80 epochs on an SFW subset. This model was eventually
           abandoned due to ineffective results.
       * - yolov8m_as02
         - 2023.12
         - Spinoff model started using an SFW training subset. It includes 26 classes and was trained for
           30 epochs, offering a more public-friendly model with reduced NSFW content.
       * - yolov8m_as03
         - 2024.1
         - Advanced spinoff model from as02 with 26 classes, trained for 60 epochs. This SFW subset model
           aims to reduce bottlenecks and improve reproducibility of results.

         - Description
       * - yolov8s_aa06
         - 2023.8
         - Initial version for current reincarnation with 24 classes trained for 90 epochs. Focuses on general
           torso components and includes some NSFW content.
       * - yolov8s_aa09
         - 2023.10
         - Added HHORSE and HBIRD classes, updating the dataset with more head closeups and adjusting for
           large hats, trained from aa06.
       * - yolov8s_aa10
         - 2023.12
         - Major training dataset update from aa09, focusing on improving detection of HHORSE and HBIRD and
           fixing issues with heads wearing large hats.
       * - yolov8s_aa11
         - 2024.1
         - Latest mainstream general torso components model with 26 classes. It includes an update from aa10
           with outstanding mAP scores, though noted to be not completely fair due to training set biases.
