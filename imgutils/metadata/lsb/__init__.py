"""
This module provides functionality for reading and writing metadata and data using
LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography in images.

Imported from .read:

- ImageLsbDataExtractor: Class for extracting LSB data from images.
- LSBExtractor: Class for extracting LSB data from byte arrays.
- LSBReadError: Exception raised when there's an error reading LSB data.
- read_lsb_metadata: Function to read metadata embedded in an image using LSB.
- read_lsb_raw_bytes: Function to read raw bytes embedded in an image using LSB.

Imported from .write:

- serialize_pnginfo: Function to serialize PNG metadata.
- serialize_json: Function to serialize JSON-compatible data.
- inject_data: Function to inject data into an image using LSB.
- write_lsb_metadata: Function to write metadata into an image using LSB.
- write_lsb_raw_bytes: Function to write raw bytes into an image using LSB.

This module combines reading and writing capabilities for LSB steganography,
allowing users to embed and extract data or metadata from images seamlessly.
